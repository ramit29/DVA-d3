a2.The Wins + Nominations vs Ratings graph(1st graph) is better at separating the data than the budget vs ratings graph(2nd graph). In the first graph the data has clustered in such a way, that to the naked eye a linear functions seems enough to capture the difference between good and bad rating, but no such clustering of data is visible in the second graph.

c.Log scaled axis are better when the values in a dataset have a very big range, taking the logarithm of the values will help with better visualization than a linear scale of those values.
  Square-root scaled axis is good at de-cluttering data and providing an even spread of the data as it scales quickly even for a small difference in values, it is also good for representing values with a big range difference.
